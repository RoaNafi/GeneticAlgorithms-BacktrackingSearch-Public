## Overview ##
This project simulates and optimizes the operations of a local package delivery shop. The system is designed to efficiently manage delivery routes and resource allocation to minimize operational costs. It involves algorithms and strategies to assign packages to delivery vehicles and specify routes to minimize the total traveled distance by all vehicles.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to implement a system that solves the package-vehicle assignment problem to minimize the total traveled distance by all vehicles in the shop. The system allows the user to choose from two algorithms: genetic algorithms or utilize backtracking search (CSP formulation).

## Requirements ##
Implementation of algorithms:  genetic algorithms, backtracking search (CSP formulation).
The user should be able to choose the algorithm at runtime.
User should be able to specify the number of available vehicles, their capacity, and package specifications.
User interface to display the generated solution.

## Technologies Used ##
Programming Language: Python

IDE: PyCharm
